A: Implementing binary search will be applicable for all criteria except for searching for author name, serial title, paper type and random methods.
	Because once the lists are sorted with unique string, it would be easy to perform, but once there are same varibles are stored, it would be no efficient
	to perform since there will be a confusion over the algorithm and will be possible to pull out the results that would not be expected..
